# Contributing to Oh Hey World

## Before You Start

Anyone wishing to contribute to the **[Oh Hey World](https://github.com/oh-hey-world/ohheyworld-platform/)** project **MUST read & sign the [Electronic Oh Hey World Contribution License Agreement](http://www.ohheyworld.com/cla)**. We will not accept any pull requests from users who have not signed the CLA first.

## Reporting Bugs

1. Always update to the most recent master release; the bug may already be resolved.

2. Make sure you can reproduce your problem at [www.ohheyworld.com](http://www.ohheyworld.com)

4. If this is a bug or problem that **requires any kind of extended discussion**. Do *not* open a bug on GitHub.

5. If this is a bug or problem that is clear, simple, and is unlikely to require *any* discussion -- it is OK to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/oh-hey-world/ohheyworld-platform/issues) with a reproduction of the bug including workflows, screenshots, or links to examples on [www.ohheyworld.com](http://www.ohheyworld.com). If possible, submit a Pull Request with a failing test. If you'd rather take matters into your own hands, fix the bug yourself (jump down to the "Contributing (Step-by-step)" section).

6. When the bug is fixed, we will do our best to update the GitHub issue with a resolution.

## Requesting New Features

1. Do not submit a feature request on GitHub; all feature requests on GitHub will be closed. Instead, visit the **[Feature Requests wiki page category](https://github.com/oh-hey-world/ohheyworld-platform/wiki/Feature-Requests)**, and search this list for similar feature requests. It's possible somebody has already asked for this feature or provided a pull request that we're still discussing.

2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add. The feature must apply to a wide array of users of Oh Hey World. You may also want to provide us with some advance documentation on the feature, which will help the community to better understand where it will fit.

3. If you're a Rock Star programmer, build the feature yourself.

## Contributing (Step-by-step)

1. Visit the **[Developer Start Kit Wiki Page](https://github.com/oh-hey-world/ohheyworld-platform/wiki/Developer-Starter-Kit)**

2. Responding to Feedback

  The Oh Hey World team may recommend adjustments to your code. Part of interacting with a healthy open-source community requires you to be open to learning new techniques and strategies; *don't get discouraged!* Remember: if the Oh Hey World team suggests changes to your code, **they care enough about your work that they want to include it**, and hope that you can assist by implementing those revisions on your own.
