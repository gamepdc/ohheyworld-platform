Sharing where you are with those who care is easier than ever!

When you arrive in a new destination -- the first thing every single traveler does is check-in with someone. That could mean your parents who are worried whether you landed safely. It could mean your girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife or best friend back home. Or it could mean sharing your new location on Facebook or Twitter so your social media audience knows your whereabouts.

We’re simplifying that check-in process to 1 click.

How does it work?

Enter the City, State if in the US or City, Country if abroad, then click Check In...

What happens next?
You can select which private notifications to send to parents, significant other, or close friends(you have the option to turn them on/off per check-in)
Choose whether you want a notification pushed to Twitter or Facebook
Your location is logged in your travel log
You’ll see other locals and travelers nearby -- your Facebook friends, friends of your Facebook friends, and all travelers checked-in on Oh Hey World.
From there, you can click through to their profiles to learn more, or “follow” them to keep tabs on their location from your dashboard.

We’re working feverishly at adding features by the day and polishing up the existing user interface. You can learn more about what we’re working on next here (http://www.ohheyworld.com/travelblog/whats-next/).

Of course, we’d absolutely love your feedback so we can improve upon our product in the coming weeks prior to allowing access to a larger audience. The best method for feedback would be this form (http://www.ohheyworld.com/product-feedback.html) but you can also reach out on Twitter to @drewmeyers
